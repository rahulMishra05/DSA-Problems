                NOTES
**************************************************************************

1. No need to know size beforehand.

2. Performing operations like concatenation & append is easier.

3. Terminate with a special character '\0'

4. In string if we want to enter a sentence than we have to use "getline()"
    @ We can use that in this way
        string str;     // Declared a string
        getline(cin, str);      // Taking input
        cout<< std << endl;     // Printing output

5. If we want to combine/append two strings than we can do that in two ways
    @ string s1 = "fam";
    string s2 = "ily";
     
     then one way is like this "s1.append(s2)" => In this s1 is getting changed.
     Another way is like this " cout<<s1 + s2 " => Here we are simply adding the two string and no original sting is getting changed.

6. Suppose we have a string named "abc" and we have some values in it, now we want to clear it  
    so we can clear that string using clear funciton just like this 
    " abc.clear(); "

7. If we want to compare two strings than we can use "compare" function 

8. if we want to check whether our string is empty or not than we can do that by using empty function 

9. To delete some character from the string we use erase() function

10. To find somethings in the string we sue find() function

11. insert() funciton

12. size() or length() => To find the length of the string

13. To find the substring of the string we can use substr() function

14. String to integer => stoi()
    @ Integer to string => to_string()
