		Notes of Array

1. Array: It is a list of variables of similar types

2. Time complexity of linear search is O(n)

3. To implement binary search the elements in the array should be present in sorted order.

4. Time complexity of binary search is O(log(n))

5. Selection Swap: Find the minimum element in unsorted array and wap
	it with element at begining.
