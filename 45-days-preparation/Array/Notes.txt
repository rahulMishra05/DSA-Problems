		Notes of Array

1. Array: It is a list of variables of similar types

2. Time complexity of linear search is O(n)

3. To implement binary search the elements in the array should be present in sorted order.

4. Time complexity of binary search is O(log(n))

5. Selection Swap: Find the minimum element in unsorted array and wap
	it with element at begining.

6. Bubble Sort: Reapetedly swap two adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
	@ After the first pass the largest element will come at the last position.
	@ We will repeat this step, untill we get a completely sorted array.
	@ If the lenght of our array is "n", then we have to do "n-1" iteration to get sorted array.

7. Insertion Sort: Insert an element from unsorted array to its correct position in sorted array.
